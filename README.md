# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview
Utilizing data from the samples.json file, visualizations must be created for research participants to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.

## Purpose
Create three different charts to allow users to visualize the research data and deploy the resulting dashboard to a webpage.  Users should be able to select their unique ID number from the dropdown and the charts should update with the appropriate data.

## Resources
 - Data Source: [samples.json](samples.json)
 - Software: JavaScript, HTML, Plotly, D3, Visual Studio Code

## Results - [View Dashboard](https://jrobert2121.github.io/plotly_deployment/)

Three charts were created using JavaScript and Plotly:
 - Horizontal Bar Chart: used to display the top 10 bacterial species for the selected ID with hover text.
 - Bubble Chart: used to display the bacterial cultures contained in each sample for the selected ID with appropriate hover text.
 - Gauge Chart: used to display the selected ID's weekly washing frequency value.

Using HTML, a dashboard containing the above charts was deployed.  Some customizations on the dashboard include:
 - Adding an image to the jumbotron
 - Changing the font color within the jumbotron
 - Adding a background color to the page
 - Webpage is mobile responsive
